      <i class="material-icons"> Context of Phd study</i>
        <p> This research comes at a time of concern of student mental health. Suicide rates in UK universities have never been higher and there has been a fivefold increase in student disclosure of mental health problems in a decade (BBC). An 2017 IPPR survey found that 94% of higher education providers experienced a rise in demand for counselling services in the past five years and 61% reported a rise in demand of more than 25%. The same survey reports that at some universities one in four students is using or waiting to use counselling services. Various reasons for this trend has been put forward, including this generation of undergraduates experiencing.  The report makes several recommendations including to spend more money on student mental health services and to obtain better data on which interventions most improve student mental health services. However, these recommendations seem to miss the point about preventing students becoming in need of such services in the first place. Sir Anthony Seldon, former Master of Wellington College and current (2018) vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham commented:</p>

        <p>My research is about an aspect of the human condition, namely growth, and how this is experienced by undergraduates in the context of coaching. I argue that growth can be intentionally stimulated through coaching. I also explore what growth actually is for these students and how they experience it. This may help other students and professionals to recognise and encourage growth in the highly contextualised arena of university. I also offer recommendations for how you can help foster your own growth. </p>
